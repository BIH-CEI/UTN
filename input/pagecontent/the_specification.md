### Profiles and Extensions
To claim conformance to an UTN Profile, servers SHALL be able to populate all profile data elements that have a minimum cardinality >= 1 and/or flagged as Must Support as defined by that profileâ€™s StructureDefinition.

### General Guidance
This section outlines important definitions, interpretations, and requirements common to all UTN actors used in this guide. The conformance verbs - SHALL, SHOULD, MAY - used in this guide are defined in FHIR Conformance Rules.

Given the general conformance requirements outlined above, this IG does not add any Must Support flags to its profiles. Fields that are used for exchange are all present in the differential view for each profile, documented in the data dictionary, and in the documentation for each profile.

### Data Elements Supported
This IG is intended to support all of the data elements in current use for the [use cases] that are within scope.

### Interpretation of Missing Data
Much of the content of the FHIR Documents defined in this IG is optional. If optional content is not included, the associated data elements as defined for the particular use case are to be considered unknown.  The presence of a significant number of Observations defined in this IG is used to represent a box checked on a form, but there is no way to explicitly represent lack of check in the box. For some collections of fields, the IG provides a way to affirmatively represent a "none-of-the-above" for the collection.
